<h2 class="nobreak">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>In this volume I have endeavored to place before the public
a novel method of real scientific massage movements combined
with exercises, so that the benefits of both may be obtained
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The simplicity of its technic together with its ready personal
application make it possible for any individual to achieve excellent
results from its use.</p>

<p>The application of scientific massage movements stimulates
the nerves, tissues, muscles, organs, vessels, glands and cells
much more beneficially and effectively than general exercises.
Their combined application is physical culture in its most scientific
and perfected form.</p>

<p>In working out a practical presentation of this system, it
was noted that the massage movements and the most beneficial
exercises could be combined readily and simply (although this
must be done in a prescribed way) and that their balanced, logical
combination resulted in a method far superior to all other
systems of exercises, not only for the maintenance of health, but
for special therapeutic and physiologic purposes.</p>

<p>The exercises are chiefly intended for use at home, and will
be found to be more advantageous to the individual than any
course of physical culture offered anywhere. No gymnastic
equipment is necessary and no expenditure, save that of the
time required, which will vary mostly from twelve to twenty-five
minutes daily according to the time, need and inclination
of the individual.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>Dear Sir:</i></p>

<p><i>It is a pleasure to recommend most highly your system of
massage and exercises combined. I have observed the excellent
results—from your method of massage alone—in so many of the
patients at the Polyclinic Hospital—both in my own patients and
in those of the other physicians that I do not hesitate to endorse
your statements. The fact that no apparatus is necessary for the
combined massage exercises, which are thus automatically graduated
according to each person’s strength and condition, is a most
desirable feature.</i></p>

<p><i>They are especially adapted to be used by men, women and
children as a permanent physical culture course.</i></p>

<p><i>I am glad to have had the privilege of looking over the manuscript
of your system of combined massage and exercise.</i></p>

<p><i>The results so far as I have observed them have been excellent.
This combined treatment possesses manifest advantages over either
massage or exercises given separately.</i></p>

<p><i>The fact that no apparatus is needed and that the strength
of the individual adapts the course or treatment to his particular
need, renders it generally applicable.</i></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="ATHLETIC_INSTRUCTORS">ATHLETIC INSTRUCTORS</h2>

</div>

<p>The tendency of most instructors or athletes, when presenting
exercises, is to lay stress upon the production of large muscles,
capable of certain performances. Some even go so far as
to relate specific feats, which they are able to accomplish by
reason of their great muscular power, which, it may be observed,
is not necessarily indicative of good health. Oftentimes
they have obtained this muscular strength by other exercises
than the ones described in their books, or they have been
accustomed to hard work from early youth, or are naturally
strong. But the impression is conveyed that any individual
can acquire the same muscular strength by practicing their
exercises.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that Sandow in his “Magazine for
Physical Culture,” criticizes the abdominal muscles of a Danish
instructor in athletics by the name of Muller, as almost abnormally
developed, and Muller in turn retorts that Sandow’s
arms and legs are too thick for their length, and his figure is
too clumsy. That Mr. Muller has a better figure than Mr.
Sandow is true, as is likewise the fact that the latter has given
too much attention to heavy-weight lifting. Sandow is not as
tall as Muller, however, and quite naturally if a man of small
stature has the same muscular development as a taller man, it
is conclusive that the figure of the smaller must appear more
clumsy.</p>

<p>It does not follow that two persons practicing the same
exercises will develop similar figures, although some men and
women, who teach or publish courses in physical culture, often
give their pupils or readers this impression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>However, any good exercises will improve the figure.
What is significant is the fact that Sandow and Muller are
arguing so much about a matter of no vital importance. Both
might be sound and healthy, even if what they say about each
other is true.</p>

<p>In a book of exercises published by Mr. Muller, mention is
made of some rubbing or skin exercises, as they are called.
These are practically only skin deep, as far as the rubbing is
concerned. Mr. Muller correctly admits this in an explanation
that the rubbing provides for a kneading of the entire surface
of the skin. The English translator of the book likewise explains,
in his Introduction, that the rubbing exercises are an
endeavor to restore to its due position, the proper care of the
skin.</p>

<p>There is a great difference between scientific massage movements
and rubbing, although this may not be evident to the
layman. While scientific massage movements also benefit the
skin, their influence upon the deeper lying vessels, organs,
nerves and muscles is of far greater importance.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="RESULTANT_BAD_EFFECTS">RESULTANT BAD EFFECTS FROM THE USE OF HEAVY APPARATUS, WEIGHTS AND TOO
STRENUOUS EXERCISES</h2>

</div>

<p>Something similar to what happened to the frog that
wanted to be as large as the ox occurs in many a young man,
who begins to exercise with heavy apparatus and weights in
order to develop his muscles. Usually in the first or second
month there will be a marked increase of development of the
muscles and believing that this relative development will continue,
he becomes over-enthusiastic and works so vigorously
that he suffers from his mistake. Then, if the exercises are
suddenly stopped and not gradually decreased, and if the poisonous
substances and fatigue matter accumulated in the muscles
are not removed by massage, the result will be muscles that
are too hard and too stiff, with the accompanying ill effects.
Such exercises also place too great a strain upon the nerves,
heart and other organs of the body. The energy it demands
ought to be put to a better purpose; as Jules Claretie of the
Theatre Français in Paris aptly said, when discussing some
rough sport, “Think though about other things.”</p>

<p>Most apparatus used for exercise acts too artificially.</p>

<p>Because a person possesses great muscular strength, it
does not necessarily follow that his organs and nerves have a
proportionate strength and vitality. Many noteworthy examples
of this fallacy may be cited. Thus, for instance, Ellegaard,
known as one of the best cycle riders in the world, some
fifteen years ago, was rejected as a soldier. John L. Sullivan,
the boxer, died of a weak heart. Les Darcy, the boxer from
Australia, who was to have fought Jess Willard, succumbed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
to pneumonia within a few days after his illness, and many
other athletic exponents have impaired their health or gone to
too early a grave, the victims of professional ambition.</p>

<p>One should be by no means adverse to well developed and
strong muscles, so long as the elasticity and rhythm of the
movements of the body are unimpaired, but if the nerves and
organs have been overtaxed in the development of the muscles,
the result is a weaker instead of a stronger individual.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that while the man with big and
hard biceps muscles may be able to lift a heavier weight than the
man with more supple and elastic muscles, the latter would lift
a smaller weight a greater number of times. Both would improve
their performance after five minutes of massage had been
applied to the arms.</p>

<p>When practicing the combined massage exercises set forth
in this book, the muscles become massaged during each exercise.</p>

<p>The strongest athlete may exert the same strength that he
employs in heavy-weight lifting, or apparatus work, when applying
these massage movements to the body, without any of
the possible ill effects resulting from heavy gymnastic work.
The use of such strength in the combined massage exercises will
thus result in benefit for the body in the form of massage, and
this will greatly assist in re-establishing the vitality that might
have been lost by excessive strenuous exercises.</p>

<p>It should not be construed that these arguments are intended
as advice to refrain from outdoor exercises and sports.
Anyone and everyone should practice and participate in any
sports suitable to their temperament, time and purse, but care
should be taken not to overtax the strength or vitality.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SPECIAL_BENEFIT_TO_WOMEN">SPECIAL BENEFIT TO WOMEN FROM THE USE OF THESE EXERCISES</h2>

</div>

<p>The combined massage exercises are extremely beneficial
to women and girls of all ages.</p>

<p>Women suffer more from constipation than men. This
may be due to the use of corsets, which at times prevent the
respiratory muscles from being put into full play, or hinder the
blood from circulating freely and often cause flabbiness or even
atrophy to the abdominal and pectoral muscles. It is therefore
often the original and chief cause of disorders in the digestive
and abdominal organs.</p>

<p>It is especially important that women, looking forward to
motherhood, should possess strong and healthy abdominal organs
and muscles. These will cause a quick and natural delivery
of the child; and children born under such conditions are
not likely to suffer deforming injuries, as for instance, the tearing
of a nerve leading to an arm (brachial paralysis), etc.,
which often occurs when artificial means have to be used at
their birth.</p>

<p>Pregnancy is, however, not feared so much either for the
inconvenience of carrying the infant or its delivery, but chiefly
because of the current idea that a woman may lose her girlish
appearance or not feel as young as before; this has often happened
to many. If from early youth a woman has exercised
and trained her abdominal muscles, the state of pregnancy will
be less disagreeable. She would also look forward to this state
with more hope and delight, if she could be made to realize that
by care, massage and exercises of the abdominal muscles, after<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
having recovered from her accouchement, she could regain her
former figure and appearance.</p>

<p>The combined massage exercises, Nos. 10, 3, 7 and 5 are
most beneficial for the abdominal organs and muscles. The
massage movements in Nos. 10 and 3 are especially beneficial,
for pelvic exudations; they cause a quicker and more complete
removal of same.</p>

<p>If girls of thirteen years of age or younger would begin to
practice the combined massage exercises and the breathing exercises
for fifteen or twenty minutes each day, irregularities in
periodical exudations could be prevented in most cases; the
chest would be firmer and it would do much to allow the change
into womanhood to proceed without any injury to the nerves or
general health.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CONSTRUCTION_AND_CHARACTERISTICS">THE CONSTRUCTION AND CHARACTERISTICS OF THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISES</h2>

</div>

<p>The chief characteristics of the exercises presented in this
book is that scientific or medical massage movements (not mere
rubbing) have been combined with the essentials of preliminary
gymnastic exercises, such as for instance, bending, stretching
and circulating movements of the arms, the bending of the body
(trunk) backward, forward and to the side, turning and rolling
it to the right or left, and bending and stretching the legs.</p>

<p>By this combined application of the massage movements
with the movements of the body, there is also obtained the benefit
of the essential characteristics of the Indian Yogis system
or concentration exercises, so-called after the old Hindus,—the
Yogi. For example, one of their exercises consisted of placing
the backs of the hands on the back, and by concentrating
the mind on the muscles of the arms a stationary pressure was
exerted on that part of the body. Another consisted of clutching
the hands firmly (with arms at sides) and rising up on toes,
at the same time concentrating the mind on the muscles of the
arms and legs. The Yogis also practiced other exercises, in
which the hands exerted a stationary pressure on other parts
of the body and against a wall.</p>

<p>The few more or less fantastic systems of exercise presented
during the last fifty years, which consist mainly in producing
an imaginary resistance to the muscles by will power only, originate
from the Indian Yogis.</p>

<p>In the exercises presented in this book a natural, better and
more agreeable resistance to the muscles of the legs, arms and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
trunk is secured by stroking and pressing with the hands on the
body and limbs. <b>Here the pressing is not stationary</b>, as in the
Indian and similar exercises, but it is done while the hands are
stroking. <b>This stroking and pressing</b> is done in such a manner
that it is identical with scientific massage movements, some of
which have been used by specialists prominent in Europe and
America. To the exercises are also added those which in the
author’s experience at hospitals in New York, have been found
to be productive of the best results. The only difference is
that they are here joined to the movements of the body and are
performed by the individual.</p>

<p>These massage movements have a far greater beneficial
effect—therapeutically as well as physiologically—than the
body movements themselves, to which they are combined. A
brief explanation of their effects may here be interpolated.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. They bring about increasing activity in the glands
and vessels of the skin and muscles. Waste
and poisonous substances are carried away by
the lymph and blood supply and disposed of
through the skin, lungs and kidneys more
readily than otherwise.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Flabby and atrophied muscles are nourished and
restored, while hard and contracted muscles
are made more soft and supple; and fatigue
matter removed from them.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. They stimulate and nourish the nerves and through
them the tissues and organs of the body.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. They cause increased combustion in the tissues,
more carbonic acid gas is eliminated and more
oxygen absorbed, thereby stimulating and increasing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
respiration through the lungs and
skin pores.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. The massage movements will likewise stimulate
and cause increased activity in the digestive
organs. The flow of the digestive juices from
the liver and pancreas, which are essential
for proper digestion and absorption of food,
is increased. They assist in preventing engorgement
of the liver and are very beneficial
to that organ. The stomach and intestines are
influenced directly by the mechanical action of
the massage movements and indirectly through
nourishment of the nerve centres controlling
them.</p>

<p class="hanging">6. The direct action of the kidneys and bladder is also
stimulated, so that waste and poisonous substances
are eliminated more quickly.</p>

<p class="hanging">7. The heart is influenced not only by massaging
around and over its region, thus stimulating
the muscles and nerves surrounding it, but
also through the influence of the massage
movements on the circulation of the blood.
The strength of the heart-beat is thus increased
and the number decreased.</p>

<p class="hanging">8. Weak eyes have been benefited by the effect of
massage on the nervous system.</p>

</div>

<p>Summarizing, it may be seen that: (1) In the massage
exercises the essentials of preliminary gymnasium exercises are
included with their resultant benefit. (2) The therapeutic
and physiologic beneficial effect of scientific massage movements<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
are obtained. (3) The benefit of the essential characteristics
of the concentration system originated by the Hindus
is secured and in a much more effective facile and agreeable
manner. (4) In addition, there accrue the other general advantages
which the massage exercises possess. A few of these
may be noted:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">a. The maximum of effect with the minimum of
effort.</p>

<p class="hanging">b. The stretching, pressing, stimulating and nourishing
of the nerves in a natural way.</p>

<p class="hanging">c. The avoidance of mental fatigue. The longer the
exercises are practiced the more they are liked,
because of their agreeable nature and immediate
effect.</p>

<p class="hanging">d. Inasmuch as they are regulated by the pressure of
the hands, they may be adapted to any required
degree and thus are equally beneficial
to all, from the most developed athlete down
to the little child old enough to understand
their execution.</p>

<p class="hanging">e. The exercises may also be used in different disordered
and diseased conditions of the body,
of a mild character, in which massage is helpful.
A person with injured legs and even one
with no legs at all will be able to practice some
of them in a sitting or lying posture; namely,
massage exercises Nos. 1, 2, 10 and 12, and
without the movements of the body also Nos.
8, 11 and 14.</p>

<p class="hanging"><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">f. Because they improve the circulation of blood and
lymph, enrich the blood, burn away fatty
tissues, build up muscles, and have the most
beneficial influence on the nerves and glands;
they will improve the appearance and the
figure of both stout and thin.</p>

<p class="hanging">g. They will preserve youth and retard old age.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COMMENTARIES">COMMENTARIES AS TO THEIR USE</h2>

</div>

<p>The massage exercises are chiefly intended to serve as a
daily course for men, women and children, in order to preserve
and improve their health, vitality, energy and figure.</p>

<p>The best method to adopt is to practice all the combined
massage exercises in their order together with a special or
general deep breathing exercise at the intervals as explained
in Chapter “Synoptic Review,” <a href="#SYNOPTIC_REVIEW">page 78</a>. In this way the massage
movements and the movements of the body are applied
in the best proportion. Whether the massage exercises are
done five, ten or fifteen times each, or more, the time allotted
for the deep breathing at the intervals indicated should not
exceed fifteen seconds.</p>

<p>Practicing all the exercises from five to fifteen times each
in the manner noted will require from twelve to twenty-five
minutes (i.e., one performance), which will be most suitable
to all who are using them as a daily course. Old and stout
persons will probably require a little more time for one performance
than is necessary for those who are younger, thinner
or more athletic. There is, however, nothing to prevent anyone
from increasing the time to half an hour or even longer
if desired; or, the performance may be made to last as long
as the performer might have been accustomed to exercise in a
gymnasium. The average time required for doing each massage
exercise five times will be found in the descriptions.</p>

<h3 id="THE_PRESSURE_OF_THE_HANDS">THE PRESSURE OF THE HANDS</h3>

<p>The massage exercises not only may be regulated and made
more or less vigorous by increasing or decreasing their number
and speed, but also by increasing or decreasing the pressure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
of the hands while stroking the body. They can thus be practiced
fifteen times each with a light pressure and not tire as
much as if they are practiced five times each with a stronger
pressure.</p>

<p><b>A light pressure</b> is accomplished when practically only the
weight of the hands is put into play.</p>

<p><b>The strongest pressure</b> is exerted when the fingers and
hands are used as forcefully as possible.</p>

<p><b>A moderate pressure</b> is one which is midway between no
real pressure and the most forceful.</p>

<p><b>A strong pressure</b> is then somewhat more forcible than the
moderate.</p>

<p>A powerful pressure with the hands will of course give
a more effective massage and make the movements of the body
and limbs more vigorous, thus influencing the entire body to
a greater degree than will a light pressure. However, this
does not mean that it is necessary or most practical to utilize
the strongest pressure possible, although even that may be
done without causing harm, since the massaging of the muscles
will automatically prevent any stiffness or ill effects.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that by the strongest pressure is
meant the strongest that one is able to exert upon oneself.
Let us take, for example, two persons of widely different physical
strength, such as a powerful wrestler and a little girl of
about ten years of age. If the wrestler uses the strongest pressure
possible for him to exert, that pressure would not be
harmful to him (provided, of course, that he has had no recent
injuries), since his body is proportionately strong. The little
girl, however, cannot endure the pressure that the wrestler is
able to exert on his body, but she will not be able to press so
forcibly. She will, however, be able to endure the strongest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
pressure that she can exert, because its strength will be in proportion
to the strength of her body.</p>

<p>If it is a question as to whether each exercise should be
practiced a lesser number of times with the strongest pressure
or a greater number of times with a moderate or strong pressure,
the latter method is not only advisable but preferable.</p>

<p>Therefore, in most instances a moderate or strong pressure
should be used when the same pressure is exerted throughout
one performance.</p>

<p><b>Using different degrees of pressure</b> for one exercise is
not only quite practical, but also as effective as using the same
pressure for one performance. For instance, if an exercise is
practiced five times, the first time a light pressure may be
exerted, the second time a moderate, the third time a strong,
the fourth also a strong and the fifth a moderate pressure.</p>

<p>If an exercise is done ten times the different degrees of pressure
can, of course, be accomplished with more variation. In
other words, a changing pressure may be utilized by gradually
increasing it each time, until the exercise has been executed
five or six times, then gradually decreasing for each of the
remaining four or five times. If the exercise is practiced fifteen
times, increase the pressure until the seventh or eighth
time, decreasing it for each of the remaining times, and so
forth.</p>

<h3 id="THE_DEGREE_OF_EXERTION">THE DEGREE OF EXERTION</h3>

<p>Whether the massage exercises are practiced a lesser number
of times with a strong pressure or a greater number of times
with a light pressure and whether they are executed quickly or
slowly; each exercise may be practiced until the desired fatigue
is induced.</p>

<p>A boxer, wrestler or any other athlete in training may wish
to practice the exercises in such a manner and to such an extent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
that complete fatigue results. The same may be true in the
case of stout people who wish to reduce, when the heart and
other vital organs are not essentially weakened.</p>

<p>Men, women and children who use the exercises daily for
improving and preserving their health will undoubtedly follow
a moderate course and do each exercise only until slightly
fatigued. However, more strenuous performances may be
executed, but care should be taken to avoid all extremes.</p>

<p>If any exercise provokes fatigue, the fifteen seconds deep
breathing between that and the next will probably serve to
eradicate this. If not, the pause between the massage exercise
and the breathing may be prolonged. However, the fatigue
feeling resulting from a vigorous or prolonged massage exercise
will not last as long as that which results from other exercises
with similar exertion. This is due to the influence of the massage
movements.</p>

<h3 id="THE_BEST_TIME_FOR_THE_EXERCISES">THE BEST TIME FOR THE EXERCISES</h3>

<p>While it is well to do exercises in the morning, the majority
do not feel inclined to exert themselves vigorously immediately
upon arising. Neither is it scientifically correct, since the
body has been inactive and in a prone position for several hours.
The following procedure is advisable:</p>

<p>Upon arising, practice the general and special breathing
exercises without strain, about two times each. This will benefit
the heart action and the circulation. Subsequently, or after
the bath, practice all the massage exercises from five to ten
times each. If there is no time for all, practice exercises No.
7 or 5, or both.</p>

<p>Get the habit of proper breathing from early morning.</p>

<p>If a bath is taken every morning, a warm shower gradually
getting cooler is preferable.</p>

<p>The afternoon or evening, about half an hour before dinner,
is also a desirable time for exercising, since the flow of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
gastric juices will be stimulated and cause the entire digestive
system to be in its best condition for the reception of food.
It is best not to do any violent exercising within at least three-quarters
of an hour after a substantial meal has been taken.</p>

<p>If the massage exercises are practiced for about ten minutes
without too much exertion, just before going to bed, it
will prove beneficial to sleep.</p>

<p>Before and after a bath in the ocean is also an opportune
time for doing the exercises.</p>

<p>It is not intended to convey the impression that all the
combined massage exercises must necessarily be performed
three times every day, although this might be very good under
proper circumstances. They should be done, however, at least
once a day, although adherence to this rule may not be feasible
at all times. For instance, on a very hot day, with a high
degree of humidity, when continual perspiration is induced,
it may seem desirable to omit them. However, if only one or
two massage exercises are done in the morning it is advisable
that all of them, with the breathing exercise, at the intervals,
be practiced at least five times each later in the day. Ten
times each would be better.</p>

<p>In addition, the special and general deep breathing exercises
should be practiced separately for about five minutes once
or twice daily.</p>

<h3 id="SPECIAL_REMARKS">SPECIAL REMARKS</h3>

<p>Each exercise should be done in one uniform rhythmical
movement.</p>

<p>The room should be aired, the window open, if this is possible
without incurring draught or without too great a drop in
the temperature.</p>

<p>One is not likely to take cold when exercising but it is well
to dress quickly upon completion of the movements. Of
course in the winter the room may be warmed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span></p>

<p>If the skin is moist, a bath should be taken or the body
wiped with a wet, cool towel and thoroughly dried before the
exercises are commenced. If the body and the palms of the
hands become moist while exercising, some talcum powder
should be sprinkled on the skin.</p>

<h3>THE ILLUSTRATIONS</h3>

<p>To those, who have read the preceding chapters, it will
hardly be necessary to point out, that the exercises demonstrated
by a woman are not intended for women only but also
for men and children; and likewise the exercises demonstrated
by a man—the author—are equally beneficial for women and
children.</p>

<p>With the four fingers together and the thumbs close, place
the inner side of the fingers in the middle of the forehead, so
that the hands are nearly parallel to each other (Fig. 1 A).
Stroke from there with the fingers and palms of both hands
simultaneously up over the head; at the same time bending the

head and neck as far as possible, pressing with the fingers on
each side of the cervical vertebrae (Fig. 1 C). From here continue
the stroking with the palms of the hands and the fingers
around each side of the neck toward the throat; at the same
time bending the head slowly backward (Fig. 1 D). When the
fingers reach the throat they stroke downward on each side of
it (Fig. 1 E).</p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 1</i></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>The influence of the massage movements on the muscles,
nerves, tissues and circulation as well as on the internal organs
has already been described to some extent in the Chapter,
“Construction and Characteristics of the Combined Massage
Exercises.” Therefore, the analysis and effects of this and
the other exercises will only attempt to explain how each
exercise is combined, and what nerves, muscles and organs are
influenced by it.</i></p>

</div>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way, that there is obtained
the movements of the arms and the bending of the head
forward and backward, together with the massage of the temples,
the forehead, the scalp, the cervical vertebrae, the neck
and the throat.</p>

<p>The movements of the head, arms and hands in applying
the massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves of
the hands, arms, shoulders, the upper back, the sides and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
chest. They also stretch the muscles and nerves of the latter
two.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles, vessels, nerves and tissues
of the temples, scalp, neck, throat and likewise the glands
in the neck.</p>

<p>This exercise acts as a preventive to, and is beneficial for
headache, facial neuralgia, falling hair and a disordered circulation
to the head. It will reduce fat shoulders and necks and
will build up thin ones.</p>

<p>It is also beneficial for singers and public speakers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span></p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_2">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 2</h3>

<p>Massaging each arm and side alternately from the wrist
along the upper aspect of the arm up over shoulder to the base
of the neck, then from the wrist again along the under side of
the arm over armpit and part of shoulder blade down the same
side of body and across the lower chest to the opposite side; at
the same time exercising the arms and shoulders.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing or sitting erect in a bed or chair.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 700px;">

<p class="caption"><span class="smcap">Exercise No. 2.</span></p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 2 E. <span class="spacer">Fig. 2 F.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Stretch the left arm to the front, holding it at such an angle
that the tip of the fingers are at the same height or slightly
higher than the top of the head, the fingers held straight and
together, with the thumbs close. Place the right hand, with
the fingers and thumb close, over the upper side of the left arm
at or on the wrist in such a way that the hand and fingers are
bent transversely over the arm, and so that the palm of the
hand and fingers are pressing equally on top and both sides of
same (Fig. 2 A).</p>

<p>Stroke thus from there along the upper side of the outstretched
arm, continuing over shoulder to the base of the neck
(Fig. 2 B). Then let the hand slip loosely backward the same
way over the arm to the wrist. Now clutch the out-stretched
arm underneath at the wrist in such a way that the thumb is on
the inner side and the four fingers on the outer side of the arm
(Fig. 2 C). Stroke thus the out-stretched arm underneath
from the wrist up to the armpit, at the same time raising it
slowly to a nearly perpendicular position. Then continue<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
downward underneath the shoulder with the four fingers
around as far as possible on the shoulder blade, and the thumb
in the armpit (Fig. 2 D). Continue downward the same side
of body, the fingers being kept as far over toward the back as
possible and the hand held transversely to the side of the body
and bent in such a way that it presses equally with the palm
and the fingers. When the hand has thus passed just below a
line horizontal to the nipple of the left breast (Fig. 2 E) let
it move across the chest underneath the nipples to the other
side, in that way, thus not altering the position of the hand
itself (Fig. 2 F).</p>

<p>During this massage of the left side and across the lower
chest, the left arm should still be held in its out-stretched position
over the head.</p>

<p>Upon completing the movement on the right side and
changing to the left, release the right hand from the chest and
put out the right arm, holding it in the same position as was the
left, in the beginning. At the same time let the left arm be
brought down with its hand on the upper side of the right wrist
and begin to stroke the right arm and side in the same manner
as the left. In thus changing from one arm and side to the
other, practically no stop should be made.</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>Doing this exercise five times will take about half a minute.
If counting every time when commencing to stroke each arm,
it will be ten counts.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note I.</span> When the upper side of one of the arms has been
massaged to the base of the neck, it is not absolutely necessary
to let the hand go back over the arm, as described, in order to
massage it underneath. The hand can simply be taken away
from the neck and the outstretched arm grasped underneath
the wrist without touching its upper side. However, it is best
performed in the way first described, but let the hands return,
barely touching the arm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span></p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 2</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is obtained
the movements of the arms together with their massage
and that of the shoulders, the sides of the upper body, the outer
sides of the upper back, and the lower chest.</p>

<p>The arms and shoulders are here exercised to a greater
extent than in exercise No. 1. Thus, for instance, if the left
arm is being stroked upward with the right hand, the muscles
of the right hand are not only exercised, but likewise those of
the left arm and shoulder, the latter are especially put into play
because the left arm is resisting the pressure of the right hand
upon it. The left arm furthermore is massaged at the same
time. The reverse is of course the case when the right arm is
massaged.</p>

<p>The movements of the arms and hands, in applying the
massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves of the
hands, the arms, the shoulders, the upper back, the sides, and
the lower chest.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles, nerves, blood and
lymph vessels of the arms, the shoulders, the sides and the
lower chest. It also stimulates the action of the liver and
strengthens that of the heart.</p>

<p>This exercise is especially beneficial for stiffness in arms
and shoulders caused by playing baseball, golf, hockey or from
other over-exertion. It will reduce fat shoulders and arms
and build up thin ones.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span></p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_3">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 3</h3>

<p>Massaging each leg alternately with both hands simultaneously
from ankle upward over leg and hip, continuing from
there with one hand above the other and parallel to each other,
directly across the abdomen, one hand moving underneath the
ribs, over the transverse colon and the stomach and the other
hand over the lower abdomen and pelvis; at the same time lifting
and stretching the legs and bending the trunk forward and
backward.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing erect with feet parallel and about four
inches apart.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 3 E. <span class="spacer">Fig. 3 F.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Bend the trunk forward, at the same time raising the right
leg about four inches from the floor, so that it is slightly bent
at the knee and hip and pointed somewhat forward. The
weight will then rest on the left leg, the knee of which should
be held as rigidly as possible. With the trunk bent forward,
clutch the right leg with both hands just above the ankle in
such a way, that the thumbs are in front on either side of the
tibia (shin-bone). The fingers of each hand, which are kept
close together are slanted downward and around the back of
the leg from each side, so that the third and fourth fingers of
each hand meet and touch at the middle line of the calf muscles.
The palms of the hands are thus on each side of the leg, the
right hand being on the right or outer side and the left on the
inner or left side (Fig. 3 A).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Stroke thus with both hands simultaneously from the ankle
upward over the lower right leg pressing the muscles with the
thumbs and especially with the inner side of the tips of the
fingers on the middle of the calf muscles.</p>

<p>While continuing over the knee and in order to conform
the hands to the shape of the thigh, turn the thumbs more transversely
over the upper side of the thigh and do the same with
the fingers underneath, so that as far as possible the muscles of
the thigh are influenced all around (Fig. 3 B).</p>

<p>The hands thus reach the groin (Fig. 3 C).</p>

<p>Here the right hand, the fingers pointed downward and
thumb close, continues upward over the side of the hip, until
the back part of the right palm is just above the crest of the
ilium, or hip bone. Here it is turned around so that the fingers
are pointing straight toward the left, or toward the middle line
of the body. Simultaneously the left hand, at the inner side
of the groin, is also turned, but in such a way that the fingers
are pointed toward the right and with the back part of the palm
it presses and strokes a short distance over the appendix and
the lower right side of the abdomen. This is done at the same
time as the right hand is stroking upward over the hip and
turned around as described (Fig. 3 D). When both hands
are thus turned, the left will be underneath the right, the fingers
of each hand pointed in an opposite direction and the
hands parallel to each other. The right foot is placed on the
floor, at the time that the hands reach the groin or hip, and at
the same time, the upper body is returned to an upright position,
the shoulders thrown slightly backward without strain.
The abdominal muscles should be neither distended nor contracted,
but kept in a natural position (Fig. 3 E).</p>

<p>Without bending the body to sides, continue thus with both
hands simultaneously across the abdomen, the right hand with
fingers first, moves underneath the ribs, and pressure is exerted
with the fingers and palm over the abdominal viscera
(the point of the liver, the transverse colon, the region of the
solar plexus, the duodenum, the pylorus, and the stomach) and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
finishes over on the left side, with the fingers moving between
the crest of the ilium, or hip bone, and the lowest border of the
ribs. The left hand with the back of the palm preceding, at
the same time strokes across the lower abdomen just underneath
the umbilicus or navel, and over to the left side, where it
is released simultaneously with the right hand (Fig. 3 F).</p>

<p>Now stroke over the left leg, hip and abdomen in a similar
way, but of course with this difference; that here the left hand
strokes upward over the outer side of the leg, over the left hip
and across the stomach from the left, above the right hand.
The latter moves from the inner side of the leg, across the lower
abdomen below the left hand. In other words, the left hand
massages over the left leg and side and from the latter across the
abdomen in the same way as the right hand does on the right
side, and likewise the right hand massages over the left leg and
side and from the latter across the abdomen, in the same way
as does the left hand on the right side.</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about half a minute.
If counting each time when commencing to stroke each leg it
will be ten counts.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note I.</span> The raising of the trunk should be the force,
which here pulls the arms and hands over the leg.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note II.</span> In bending to massage upward on each leg, the
latter can also be bent and raised as high as possible. In that
case the leg is pushed downward through the hands, while these
are pressing on it, the muscles of the thigh or hip thus being
exercised and influenced more than if the leg is raised or bent
only a short distance. On the contrary, if the leg is placed
only slightly forward with but little flexion of the knee, as
explained in the detailed description, the upper body has to
be bent further downward in order that the hands reach the
lower leg at the ankle. In this way, the muscles of the abdomen
and back are exercised and influenced to a greater extent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span></p>

<p>If the exercise is done only five times it should be executed
as explained in the <i>Detailed Description</i>; if done ten times or
more, both ways may be used about an equal number of times
each.</p>

<p>Here the movements are the same as in No. 3, except that
they are done from the position of lying flat on the back on a
bed or mattress. Those of the leg and trunk may be altered
in a similar way to those of No. 3. Thus the upper body can
remain resting with the back on the bed, while each leg is bent
up and firmly held with the hands at the ankle. The leg then
pushes itself through them (Fig. 3 A—A and B).</p>

<p>Or, the upper body can be raised and each leg kept nearly
straight or bent more or less, is then stroked while the trunk
is being bent backward and downward again on the bed (similar
to a rowing exercise) (Fig. 3 A—C and D).</p>

<p>The leg and trunk should be back and resting flat on the
bed while the hands are stroking over the hips and abdomen,
so that the latter is neither distended nor contracted, but kept
in a natural and relaxed position (Fig. 3 A—E).</p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 3 (3 A)</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined so that there is obtained practically
the same movements as in rowing, together with massage
of the legs and the abdomen. This is the case whether the
movements are done from a standing position or while lying
or sitting.</p>

<p>The movements of the legs, the trunk and the arms and
hands, in applying the massage movements, exercise the muscles
and nerves of the hands, the arms, the shoulders, the back
and the sides of the body, the chest, the abdomen and the legs.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span>
They also exercise the liver and other digestive organs and have
a beneficial influence on the heart. They stretch the nerves in
the spine in a natural way.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles, nerves and vessels of
the legs and the abdomen, also the lower point of the liver, the
pancreas, the stomach, the intestines, the different abdominal
nerve-plexuses, the appendix and the organs of the pelvis. The
heart is influenced indirectly through the circulation of the
blood.</p>

<p>This exercise is beneficial for pain and weakness in the legs,
caused by diseased conditions of the nerves, as in sciatica, partial
paralysis, etc. (See Supplement, <a href="#Page_92">page 92</a>.) It is
especially beneficial for disorders in the digestive system, as in
chronic or habitual constipation, gas in the stomach, etc. (See
Supplement, <a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>). It is beneficial to the generative organs
in women. It is especial beneficial for professional dancers
and runners and people whose profession causes great
strain on the legs.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that in this and all the other exercises
where the abdominal organs are massaged, it is important
not to let the hands go over the ribs and the upper abdominal
cavity at the same time. The digestive organs cannot be properly
reached and influenced in this way. Especially is this
the case if the hand strokes in a perpendicular position, that
is, with fingers pointing downward and not transversely. Even
if the hands were stroking over the abdomen, underneath the
ribs in a perpendicular position, this would not be sufficient for
the reason that as much pressure can not be exerted in this
way as with the hands in a transverse position. It would also
cover too many organs at one time to make a sufficient impression
upon them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span></p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_4">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 4</h3>

<p>Massaging each side alternately from the side of the knee
upward over the thigh, hip and side, then across the lower chest
or underneath the breasts, to the opposite side; and at the same
time bending the upper body from side to side.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing erect with shoulders thrown backward
and chest forward, but without strain, heels together and feet
and legs stationary.</p>

</div>

<p>Without altering the position of the legs, bend the upper
body to the right as far as possible, so that the right hand is
level with or just above the outer side of the right knee. Place
this hand, with fingers and thumb close, transversely over the
side of the thigh just above the knee so that the fingers are
pointing inward, toward the left (Fig. 4 A).</p>

<p>Stroke thus with the right hand from there upward over the
side of the right thigh, hip and trunk until the thumb is horizontal
with the nipple of the right breast, the fingers of the
hand should thus be pointing straight toward the left side. In
thus stroking upward on the right side the trunk should be bent
directly to the left (Fig. 4 B and C).</p>

<p>Then without altering the position of the body or the hand,
continue stroking with the latter, fingers first, across the lower
chest over the region of the liver under the right nipple of the
breast, toward the left side (Fig. 4 D), where the hand moves
underneath the nipple of the breast, over the lower region of
the heart and is released on that side (Fig. 4 E).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span></p>

<p>Now alternate to the left side. The upper body is still bent
to the left, and the left hand is placed on the side of the left
thigh, just above the knee (Fig. 4 E). Now massage the left
thigh, hip and side and from there across the chest with the
left hand, in the same way as the right side was massaged with
the right hand. When the hand is moving upward over the
left thigh, hip and side, the body is of course bent to the right.
After the left side has been massaged, repeat the movements
on the right and so forth, alternately.</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about fifteen seconds.
If counting every time when commencing to stroke from each
side of hip, it will be ten counts.</i></p>

</div>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 4</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a manner that there is
obtained the movements of the arms and the bending of the
body sideways, together with massage of the outer side of the
thighs, the hips, the sides of the body and the lower chest.</p>

<p>The movements of the body and arms and hands in applying
the massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves
of the arms, the shoulders, the back, the sides, the lower chest
and breasts and the abdomen. They also slightly influence the
liver, the stomach, the intestines and kidneys.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles, nerves and vessels of
the outer side of the thighs, the hips, the lower sides of the
trunk and the lower chest, as well as the liver and the heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_5">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 5</h3>

<p>Massaging the right leg with the right hand and the left leg
with the left hand simultaneously from behind the ankles upward
over the backs and sides of the lower legs, backs and sides
of the thighs, continuing a short distance upward over the hips
and from there, still with both hands at the same time, across
the abdomen and lower chest to the opposite sides, the right
hand passing from the right side underneath the ribs over to
the left side, and the left hand passing from the left side underneath
the nipples or breasts over to the right side. From there,
continue stroking with both hands simultaneously inward and
upward over the opposite nipples or breasts and the upper
chest where the hands pass each other and stroke outward to
their respective sides under the armpits; the right hand thus
stroking from the left side inward and upward over the left
nipple or breast and the left hand from the right side inward
and upward over the right nipple or breast. Release the hands
at the armpits and stroke down each side of the lower back and
buttocks with the backs of the hands. At the same time, bending
the upper body forward and backward.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing erect with heels about eight inches
apart and feet nearly parallel.</p>

</div>

<p>Without bending the legs, bend the upper body forward
as far as possible, and clutch the lower right leg with the right
hand and the lower left leg with the left hand from behind and
just above the ankles in such a way that the palm of each hand<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
is on the back of each leg, the four fingers placed around the
inner sides and thumbs around the outer sides, thus making an
equal pressure with fingers and palms of hands around each
leg (Fig. 5 A).</p>

<p>Now, stroke upward over the calf muscles and thighs, the
palms of the hands here stroking the outer sides of the latter,
the four fingers underneath and the thumb on top, at the same
time raising the trunk to an upright position (Fig. 5 B and C).</p>

<p>While the hands continue upward over the sides of hips,
turn them around so that the fingers point inward (Fig. 5 D).
Continue thus with the right hand on the right side until it is
just above the crest of the ilium, or hip bone. The left hand,
at the same time moves a little higher upward on the left side
until its thumb is nearly horizontal with the nipple of the left
breast. The trunk is now in an upright position, the shoulders
thrown well back (Fig. 5 E).</p>

<p>With the fingers of both hands thus pointing toward the
middle of the body, continue stroking with both hands simultaneously
from each side across the front of the body, to the
opposite sides, the left hand above the right, passing each other
at the middle line. Bend the trunk slightly forward at the
same time (Fig. 5 F). In other words, the right hand strokes
from the right side underneath the ribs directly over to the left
side, above the crest of the left ilium, or hip bone, and around
as far as possible on that side. The left hand strokes at the
same time from the left side across the lower chest, underneath
the nipples over to and around as far as possible on the right
side. The left forearm is thus crossed over the right (Fig. 5 G).</p>

<p>Then continue stroking with both hands simultaneously
from each side inward and upward over each breast and upper
chest. The right hand thus moving from the left side strokes
inward and upward over the left breast and across the upper
chest to the right side and ceases underneath the right armpit.
The left hand moving from the right side, strokes inward and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
upward over the right breast and across the upper chest to the
left side and ceases under the left armpit. At the same time,
the trunk which has been bent slightly forward, while the hands
were stroking across the lower chest and abdomen, is raised
and bent slightly backward. In thus stroking inward and upward
over the chest, the hands and fingers are held in the same
way as when they were on the sides of the body. When moving
over the breasts the left forearm is of course crossed over
the right (Fig. 5 H), but when reaching the middle of the
chest the hands cross, the left hand being directly above the
right (Fig. 5 I), and from there they continue stroking transversely
over the chest to their respective sides under the armpit
(Fig. 5 J).</p>

<p>The hands are now released and brought as far up on the
back as possible. The backs of the clenched hands are placed
on each side of the back, in such a way, that the knuckles at the
base of the finger of each hand are close to and opposite each
other on each side of the spinal column (Fig. 5 K). Stroke
thus from there with the backs of both hands simultaneously
downward on each side of the lower back and buttocks, the
knuckles following the spine on each side of same (Fig. 5 L).</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about half a minute.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note I.</span> If unable to place the hands behind the ankles
without bending the knees, the latter may be bent slightly or
the leg stroked at a distance from the ankle possible to reach
without bending the knees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note II.</span> When the hands are stroking and pressing over
the legs, let the raising movement of the trunk pull the out-stretched
arms up as far as the motion permits.</p>

<h4><i>Combined with Deep Breathing</i></h4>

<p>If done very slowly, deep breathing may be practiced with
this exercise in the following way:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
Inhale the air through the nose, while stroking upward over
the legs and hips and raising the upper body.</p>

<p>Exhale this air through the mouth while stroking and
pressing across the body from sides, and while the upper body
is being bent slightly forward.</p>

<p>Inhale again through the nose, while stroking inward and
upward over the chest, and while the upper body is being again
bent upward and slightly backward.</p>

<p>Retain this air in the lungs while the hands are moving
down the spine, back and buttocks.</p>

<p>Exhale this air through the mouth, while the body is being
bent downward, in order to repeat the exercise.</p>

<p>If special or general deep breathing exercises are practiced
between each massage exercise, natural breathing during this
exercise will be sufficient. In the event that the reader has little
available time and may wish to practice some deep breathing
and exercises for a few minutes, this combination will be
found admirable.</p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 5</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is so combined that there is obtained the movements
of the arms and the bending of the trunk forward and
backward together with massage of the back and sides of the
legs, the hips, the sides of the upper body, the chest and breasts,
the abdomen and lower back, and the buttocks.</p>

<p>The movements of the trunk, arms and hands, in applying
the massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves of the
arms, the shoulders and the entire upper body, including the
abdomen. The organs of the latter are influenced in the same
way. The muscles of the legs are here not exercised to the
same extent as in exercise No. 3, but if the legs are kept straight
in bending the trunk forward the great sciatic and other nerves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
of the leg are stretched in a natural way. The spinal cord is
also stretched.</p>

<p>The massage influences the legs, but not to such an extent
as in exercise No. 3, first, because each is here only massaged
with one hand and secondly, because the muscles are kept more
rigid by the bending of the body, for the reason that the weight
of the body is upon them. It influences the muscles, nerves
and vessels of the abdomen, the hips, the sides, the chest and
breasts, the lower and upper back and especially the spine and
the buttocks. It also influences the heart, the liver both from
in front and behind, and the kidneys. It influences the digestive
organs directly from in front and indirectly through
the nerves in the back.</p>

<p>To call attention to the difference between scientific massage
movements and rubbing, it may be pointed out that there
are five principal massage movements combined with the movements
of the body in this exercise, namely:</p>

<p>1. The stroking and pressing upward over the back of
the legs.</p>

<p>2. The manner in which the right hand strokes and presses
directly across the abdomen from the right.</p>

<p>3. The stroking and pressing with the left hand from the
left side over the region of the heart to the opposite side.</p>

<p>4. The stroking and pressing with the hands from each
opposite side of the lower chest, over the region of the heart
and liver inward and upward across the chest.</p>

<p>5. The manner in which the backs of the clutched hands
are stroking and pressing downward on each side of the lower
back and the spine.</p>

<p>If the hands would stroke over the front of the lower legs
and continue straight up over the abdomen and then downward
on the backs of the legs instead of upwards; neither the
nerves, muscles and vessels of the legs nor the internal organs
would be influenced in the proper way. Such rubbing would
be of little value.</p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_6">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 6</h3>

<p>Massaging with both hands simultaneously downward on
each side of back and buttocks; at the same time turning the
trunk to the right and left.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

shoulders back, but without strain, heels about five inches apart
and with the feet either pointed slightly outward to each side
or parallel to each other, arms hanging loosely at side.</p>

</div>

<p>Without altering the position of legs and feet, turn the
trunk around to the right so that if possible the chest and
shoulders are facing squarely to that side. The trunk will thus
have made a quarter of a turn to the right. While the body is
in that position, clench the hands and move them quickly
around and as far up as possible on each side of the back, the
back of the hands turned toward the body, the knuckles of each
hand opposite each other on each side of the spinal column
(Fig. 6 A).</p>

<p>Stroke thus with the backs of both hands simultaneously
downward over each side of the lower back and buttocks, where
the hands are released (Fig. 6 B).</p>

<p>Now, without altering the position of the legs or feet, turn
the trunk over to the left side, as far as possible, so that the
chest and shoulders are facing squarely to the left. Thus this
time a half turn is made. While in this position, stroke downward
on the back in the same way as when the body was turned
toward the other side (Fig. 6 C and D).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span></p>

<p>Alternate by turning to the right, that is, half a turn from
the last posture, etc.</p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 6</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is obtained
the movements of the arms and the turning of the upper
body to each side, together with massage of the lower back and
buttocks.</p>

<p>The movements of the body and the arms and hands in applying
the massage movements exercise the muscles and nerves
of the arms, the shoulders, the upper chest, the upper and lower
back, the hips and the sides of the body. They also influence
the kidneys.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles, nerves and vessels of
the lower back and buttocks, and also the kidneys, bladder and
liver and, through the back, the nerves leading to the abdominal
organs.</p>

<p>With the exception of the vibratory-pushing-movements of
the tissues over the region of the heart and liver and a new arm
movement, this exercise is a combination of some of the most
important movements of other exercises in this volume, which
are here executed in a different order. This is done, first, to
get one of the most important and concentrated exercises in the
middle of the course, and secondly, so that it can be used when

in exercise No. 5 (Fig. 7 E and F) or (Fig. 5 G to J).</p>

<p>From there let the hands be brought around and stroke
down each side of the back and buttocks with the backs of the
hands, as in exercise No. 5 (Fig. 7 G and H) or (Fig. 5 K
and L).</p>

<p>Now, swing the out-stretched arms around to the front
(Fig. 7 I), bend the elbows (Fig. 7 J) and place the palms
of the hands, with fingers out-stretched and close together, on
each opposite side of the lower chest (Fig. 7 K) and while
keeping the hands stationary on the skin, quickly move or push
this and the underlying tissues and muscles sideways four times
(Fig. 7 L).</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about one minute.</i></p>

</div>

<p><i>Notice</i>—The exercise should, like all the others, be executed
so that there is no pause between the various movements.</p>

<h4><i>Combined with Deep Breathing</i></h4>

<p>If the exercise is done slowly, deep breathing may be added
in the following way:</p>

<p>Inhale deeply and forcibly through the nose so that the
lungs are filled with air, while the hands are moving upward
over the right leg and side of hip and the body is being raised.</p>

<p>Exhale this air quickly and forcibly through the mouth,
while continuing massage over the abdomen to the left side,
with the body bent slightly forward.</p>

<p>Breathe through the nose in the same way, while the left
hand strokes the right arm and continues underneath the
shoulder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span></p>

<p>Exhale this air with force through the mouth, while the
hand continues down the right side and from there across the
lower chest.</p>

<p>Inhale and exhale when massaging up over the left leg
and hip and across the abdomen in the same way as when the
right leg and side were massaged.</p>

<p>Inhale and exhale again the same way, while the right arm
is massaging the left arm, side and across the lower chest as
when the right arm was massaged.</p>

<p>Breathe again with force through the nose, while massaging
inward and upward over the chest.</p>

<p>Retain this air in the lungs, while the backs of the hands
are stroking downward on each side of the back and buttocks
and while the arms are swinging around to the front.</p>

<p>Exhale this air through the mouth, while the hands are
vibrating or pushing the skin over the underlying tissues on
each opposite side of the lower chest, or on or underneath the
breasts. Continue this movement with the hands and do not
release them until the lungs are completely emptied of air.</p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 7</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is obtained
the movements of the arms, the bending and stretching
of the legs and the bending and raising of the body together
with the massage of the arms, sides, legs, hips, abdomen, chest
and back.</p>

<p>The movements of the legs, the upper body, the arms and
hands in applying the massage movements, exercise the muscles
and nerves of the whole body, except those of the head and
neck. They influence all the internal organs of the body.</p>

<p>The massage likewise influences the muscles, nerves, glands,
vessels and organs of the whole body except those of the head,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
neck, the middle of the uppermost part of the back and the
feet.</p>

<p>The deep breathing profoundly influences the lungs, the
blood, the nervous system, the digestive system, the heart, the
liver and the respiratory muscles.</p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_8">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 8</h3>

<p>Massaging down both sides of the lower back alternately,
with the back of each hand; at the same time turning the trunk
to the right and left.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing erect, with chest thrown forward and
shoulders back, but without strain, heels about five inches apart
and with the feet either pointed slightly outward to each side
or parallel to each other, arms hanging loosely at sides.</p>

<p class="caption">Fig. 8 C. <span class="spacer">Fig. 8 D.</span></p>

</div>

<p>Without altering position of legs and feet, turn the trunk
around to the right so that, if possible, the chest and shoulders
are facing squarely to that side, then turn it to the left, then to
the right again, and so forth, alternately. During this movement
of the trunk, stroke continually downward over each side
of the back from the end of the shoulder blade to the buttocks
with the back of each hand alternately. The hands are not
clenched, but only half closed. After one stroke is executed
that hand is lifted slightly outward from the body and placed
underneath the shoulder blade to begin stroking again. The
same movement obtains with the opposite hand alternately.
Thus the hands come into contact with the tissues only when
moving downward on the back (Fig. 8 A, B, C and D). The
speed should be about one stroke a second.</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about twenty seconds.

</div>

<p>Bend the trunk forward and slightly to the left and place
the right hand transversely on the outside of the left thigh in
such a way that the four fingers are close together and pointed
outward and backward (Fig. 9 A).</p>

<p>From there, stroke with the right hand, upward over the
side of the left thigh, hip and lower side (Fig. 9 B) and
inward and upward over the left nipple or breast and upper
chest and outward to the right armpit; at the same time raising
the trunk.</p>

<p>When the hand strokes across the upper chest the upper
body is bent to the right, but not forward (Fig. 9 C).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span></p>

<p>Release the right hand at the right armpit; while the upper
body is still bent to the right, bend it forward and place the
left hand on the outer side of the right thigh (Fig. 9 D) stroking
from there upward over the right hip, lower side and inward
and upward over the right nipple or breast and upper
chest, outward to the left armpit; at the same time raising the
upper body. This time, however, the trunk is bent to the
left, as the hand strokes the upper chest outward to the left
armpit.</p>

<p>Begin again with the right hand on the side of the left
thigh and continue thus each side alternately.</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about twenty-five seconds.

the arm and hand up as far as the motion permits.</p>

<h4 id="EXERCISE_9A">Exercise No. 9 A</h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—The same as in exercise No. 9.</p>

<p>Here the same movements are done as in Exercise No. 9,
but the following arm exercise has been added:</p>

<p>While the right hand strokes upward over the left side and
upper chest, and the body is raised and bent to the right, the
left outstretched arm is carried or swung around to the back
and upward over the head to the front and down on the outer
side of the right thigh, so that it reaches there when the right
arm is released at the right armpit. The right arm then performs
a similar movement, while the left hand is stroking
upward over the right side.</p>

<p>This is somewhat similar to a swimming arm movement.
It is also very like the motion used in throwing hand
grenades.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note I.</span> Women with well-developed breasts, who
might find it somewhat difficult to stroke inward and upward<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
over them, may stroke more or less sideways inward over
the breasts, or raise the palm or the back of the hand slightly
outward from the body.</p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 9 (9 A)</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is
obtained the movements of the arms and the bending of the
upper body forward and to the sides, together with massage
of the outer side of the thighs, the hips, the lower sides of
the body, the chest and breasts.</p>

<p>In bending the body forward and to the side, in order to
stroke upward over the opposite side from the thigh, the
body makes a sort of twisting movement which is especially
beneficial for the muscles of the lower sides, the upper abdomen
and the lower back, as well as for the liver. These
muscles then become stretched when the hand strokes outward
to the armpit, on the other side of the upper chest,
and the body is bent to that side.</p>

<p>The movements of the body and arms in applying the
massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves of the
arms, the shoulders, the back, the chest, the lower sides and
the diaphragm. They also influence the liver, the heart and
the digestive organs.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles of the outer side of
the thighs, the hips, the sides of the body and the chest and
breasts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span></p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_10">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 10</h3>

<p>Massaging with the left hand, from the side of the right
hip, straight across the lower abdomen to the left side. Then,
with the right hand, from the side of the left hip, straight
across the lower abdomen to the right side. Massaging again
with the left hand from the side of the right hip—but this
time with the hand placed about four inches higher up—inward
and upward underneath the border of the false ribs to
the sternum (the bone in the middle of the chest, and to
which the ribs are attached in front). Then massage with
the right hand from the side of the left hip inward and upward
under the false ribs to the end of the sternum, placing the
right hand on top of the left, when massaging with the latter
and vice-versa.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing erect, heels about six inches apart and
feet pointed slightly outward, legs and feet stationary.</p>

</div>

<p>Place the left hand with the right on top transversely over
the outer side of the right hip in such a way that the fingers
of the left hand are pointing outward or around toward the
back, and the hand is in line with the lower abdomen (Fig.
10 A). Stroke thus from there, straight across the lower
abdomen just underneath the umbilicus to the left side, pressing
continually with the right hand on top (Fig. 10 B and C).</p>

<p>Then stroke with the right hand and pressing with the left
on top of it from the side of the left hip directly across the
lower abdomen from that side, in the same way. (Fig. 10 D.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
Being similar to the movement just completed, only one figure
is shown here.)</p>

<p>Now, place the left hand, with the right on top of it, again
on the side of the right hip, but this time about four inches
higher up, so that the thumb is just above the crest of the
ilium, or hip bone (Fig. 10 E). Stroke from there, with the
left hand, inward and upward underneath the border of the
ribs as far as the sternum (the bone in the middle of the chest).
The palm of the hand, which of course precedes the fingers,
moves at first slightly transversely (Fig. 10 F). The inner
side of the ends of the fingers are pressed in under the ribs
with the help of the right hand until they reach the sternum
or where the ribs are slanting downwards to the left side (Fig.
10 G).</p>

<p>Stroke now, with the right hand, the left pressing on top
of it, from the side of the left hip, with the thumb just above
the hip bone, inward and upward underneath the false ribs,
that is, in the same way as was done with the left hand from
the right side. (Fig. 10 H. Here, likewise, only one figure
is shown.)</p>

<p>Thus, first stroke once from each opposite side across the
lower abdomen, then once from each opposite side inward and
upward under the ribs. The exercise has been executed once.</p>

<div class="timing">

<p><i>Five times will take about forty seconds.</i></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Note I.</span> The trunk should be kept in an upright position
and not bent to the right, left or backwards. The abdominal
muscles should be relaxed so that the stomach and bowels are
neither distended nor contracted, but are held naturally.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note II.</span> The movements can, of course, also be done
with one hand, but because pressure should be fairly strong
(especially in stout people) to influence the digestive and abdominal
organs and the nerve-centers properly, it is best to
use both hands, one on top of the other. The strain will thus
also be removed from the fingers when they are pressing inward
and upward under the false ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span></p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 10</i></h4>

<p>In this exercise especial attention is given to the massaging
of the internal organs, muscles, nerves and vessels of the
abdomen, without any movements of the body except those of
the arms.</p>

<p>The movements of the arms and hands in applying the
massage movements, exercise the muscles of the arms, the
shoulders, upper chest and back.</p>

<p>The massage influences the digestive organs and glands as
well as all the other organs in the abdomen.</p>

<p>This exercise is very beneficial for all the digestive and
abdominal organs in women as well as in men. (See also
chapter for women, <a href="#Page_17">page 17</a>, and Digestive Disorders in Supplement,
<a href="#Page_88">page 88</a>.)</p>

<h3 id="EXERCISE_11">THE COMBINED MASSAGE EXERCISE No. 11</h3>

<p>Beating with the clenched hands (women may use the
palm of the hand with the fingers outstretched), upward over
each side of abdomen and chest, and bending the upper body
backward at the same time; then beating similarly downward,
bringing the upper body forward to an upright position, while
the hands are beating downward over the chest.</p>

<h4><i>Detailed Description</i></h4>

</div>

<p>Clench the hands. With the palm and the outer side of
the fingers, which are thus turned toward the body, strike first a
light and quick blow with the right hand on the right side of
the lower abdomen (Fig. 11 A), then similarly with the left
hand on the left side of the abdomen, at the same level. Then
strike with the right hand again, one or two fingers’ breadth
further upward on the lower right half of abdomen, and again,
with the left hand, a little further up on the left side, and so
forth, up over the chest. When the hands reach the lower ribs,
and while they are thus beating upward, on each side of the
chest, to the collar bone, the upper body is bent backward, as
far as possible, but without strain (Fig. 11 B). From there,
beat the same way back and downward again over chest, at the
same time bringing the upper body forward to an upright
position. When the hands continue down over the abdomen,
the upper body is thus in a natural position.</p>

<p>The hands should give light, quick blows and rebound from
the body each time, as in the beating of a drum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> Women may use the palms of the hands, with
the fingers outstretched and close together, when beating over
the chest. Inhale the air while the upper body is being bent
backward, exhale while it is brought forward to an upright
position.</p>

</div>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 11</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is obtained
the movements of the arms and the bending of the
upper body backwards, together with the beating of the abdomen
and of the chest.</p>

<p>The beating, which in massage is called tapotement, stimulates
the nerves and contracts and stimulates the muscles, if
the blows are given very lightly and quickly. Stronger and
harder blows cause a benumbing effect upon the nerves, and
should therefore be avoided.</p>

<p>The movements of the trunk and the arms and hands, in
applying the beating, exercise the muscles and nerves of the
arms, the shoulders, the back and the abdomen.</p>

<p>The beating influences the nerves, vessels, organs and
muscles of the abdomen and the chest. It stimulates the heart
and loosens the execretion from the lungs.</p>

<p>With the four fingers and thumb close, place the right
hand transversely over the left shoulder in such a way that the
fingers are reaching as far down on the upper back as possible,
the two or three first fingers resting between the inner
border of the shoulder blade and the spine, and the thumb
close to the base of the neck (Fig. 12 A).</p>

<p>Stroke thus with the palm of the hand, the fingers pressing
more or less between the shoulder blades and spine as they
move upward, transversely over the shoulder, continuing
down the same side of upper chest (Fig. 12 B).</p>

<p>While the right hand is thus stroking the left shoulder
and upper chest, the left arm and hand is brought across and
up over the right forearm to the right shoulder, and this shoulder
is massaged continuing downward over the upper part of
the left chest, in the same way, as soon as the right arm is
released from the left side of chest.</p>

<p>The right hand is then again brought over the left shoulder
and across the left forearm and that shoulder massaged, and
so forth, alternately and evenly.</p>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is obtained
the movements of the arms together with massage of
the shoulders and the upper chest.</p>

<p>The movements of the arms and hands, in applying the
massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves of the
arms, the shoulders, the upper back and the upper chest.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles, vessels and nerves of
the shoulders and the upper chest. It increases the flow of
blood to the muscles surrounding the lungs.</p>

<p>This exercise, like No. 2, is especially beneficial for stiffness
in the shoulders and upper chest, resulting from golf or
other over-exertion in kindred sports.</p>

<p>Without bending the knees, bend the upper body forward
and cross the right forearm over the left, or the left over the
right, placing the right hand transversely over the front of
the left thigh, just above the knee; the fingers of the hand are
kept close together and pointing to or around the other side
of the thigh. Place the left hand in the same way and at the
corresponding place on the right thigh (Fig. 13 A).</p>

<p>Stroke thus upward over the front of each thigh with both
hands simultaneously, continuing from there, in the same way
upward over hips and lower sides of the body (Fig. 13 B and
C), and inward and upward over the nipples or breasts and
upper chest, where the hands cross each other and continue outward
to their respective sides underneath the armpits (Fig. 13
D, E and F).</p>

<p>Then, barely moving the arms, turn the hands from there
around on each side of the back, and without here clutching the
hands stroke now with the backs of the hands and fingers,
downward over each side of the lower back and buttocks (Fig.

<p>A special deep breathing exercise may be added in the following
way:</p>

<p>Fill the lungs with air through the nose, while stroking
from thighs up over sides and chest.</p>

<p>Retain this air in the lungs, while the hands are stroking

<p>The left hand thus strokes from the left side underneath
the nipples or breasts over on the right side and back again,
while the right hand strokes from the right side across the
upper chest, over on the left side and back again.</p>

<p>At the same time, turn the upper body slowly from side
to side without altering the position of the legs and feet. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
turning of the body and the stroking should be done evenly
and not jerkingly.</p>

<h4 id="EXERCISE_14A">Exercise No. 14 A</h4>

<p class="center">(<i>Combined with Rolling of the Trunk</i>)</p>

<p>The massaging over the chest as done in No. 14 may also
be done, while the trunk is rolled around in the following way:</p>

<p>Place the feet further away from each other—about ten
inches.</p>

<p>Begin stroking the chest, as described. Without altering
the position of the legs and feet, bend the upper body forward;
from there roll and bend it over to the right, continuing
rolling and bending it backward, then to the left and around
to the front, terminating in a forward bending. Stop here
and with the body still bent, roll in opposite direction, that is,
to the left, back, right and front.</p>

<p>The hands are, of course, stroking evenly across the chest
during the rolling.</p>

<p>The trunk may be rolled around first two or three times to
the right, and then two or three times to the left.</p>

<p>Three times each way around is equivalent to five executions.</p>

<p><i>This exercise done five times will take about twenty seconds.</i></p>

<h4><i>Analysis and Effects of the Combined Massage Exercise No. 14</i></h4>

<p>This exercise is combined in such a way that there is obtained
the movements of the arms and the turning of the
trunk, together with the massage of the chest and the upper
sides of the body.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>The movements of the body and arms and hands in applying
the massage movements, exercise the muscles and nerves
of the arms, the shoulders, the upper and lower back, the sides
and the abdomen. This also influences the kidneys.</p>

<p>The massage influences the muscles and nerves of the chest
and the sides, likewise, the heart, the liver and lungs.</p>

<h4><i>Effects of Exercise No. 14 A</i></h4>

<p>In No. 14 A the rolling exercises the muscles and nerves
of the abdomen and lower sides to a greater extent than does
the turning in exercise No. 14.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="PROPER_BREATHING">PROPER BREATHING</h2>

</div>

<p>Nothing is more important than breathing for maintaining
life, and it should be given much more attention than is
customary. This may be done not only by practicing the
special and general breathing exercises for several minutes
one or several times daily, but also by acquiring the habit of
proper breathing all the time. It is a curious fact that when
the stomach is in need of more food, it is filled and sometimes
to excess, but although the lungs are always in need of more
air, they are mostly only filled about one-half and not completely,
and this in spite of the fact that air is one of the few
gifts of life.</p>

<p>In order that the reader may notice the effect of proper
natural breathing and to acquire the habit, it may be advisable
to try the following experiment:</p>

<p>Place a watch nearby. Breathe slowly, deeply and regularly
for one or several minutes, inhaling the air each time
through the nose and exhaling it either the same way or
through both nose and mouth simultaneously. From twelve
to sixteen respirations should be done per minute.</p>

<p>Try occasionally to breathe with the diaphragm, that is,
instead of first allowing the chest to expand, when inhaling,
push the abdomen and diaphragm out first during the beginning
of the inhalation and the chest during the latter half part
of it. This is beneficial for all the digestive organs and their
nerves. The most important thing is to breathe deeply, so
that the air also reaches the bottom or points of the lungs. Of
course, twelve or sixteen respirations can be taken per minute
and the lungs become only half-filled just the same. This will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
not be of any benefit. On the contrary, it might cause anaemia,
and its accompanists, such as neurasthenia, melancholia, fear,
etc. Breathing in the right way will produce better blood,
more nerve power, and last, but not least, a good humor.</p>

<p>Apropos humor,—there are authors who, now and then in
the titles of their books or articles, admonish one to be cheerful,
to laugh and smile so as to avoid illness. Further perusal
of the text, however, will show that they admit that this depends
chiefly upon the physical condition, and they advise
the practice of exercises, in order to make people physically
fit first. This is, of course, true, since it is difficult for most
people to be of a good disposition and smile and laugh when
the body is not in fit condition.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="SPECIAL_AND_GENERAL_DEEP_BREATHING_EXERCISES">SPECIAL AND GENERAL DEEP BREATHING EXERCISES</h2>

</div>

<p>These breathing exercises done separately or between the
massage exercises will develop the chest and lungs. Causing
more oxygen to be introduced into the blood and increased
elimination of carbonic-acid gas, the blood is enriched, the
energy increased and power developed to withstand or repulse
attacks of disease. A direct as well as an indirect influence
is also produced upon all the vital organs of the body.</p>

<h3><i>The Special Deep Breathing Exercise</i><br />
No. I</h3>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing or sitting erect, with shoulders back,
but without strain, arms hung loosely downward to sides.</p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Inhale as deeply as possible through the nose.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Retain the air for one or two seconds.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Join the lips in such a way that a small opening
remains in the middle and throw only a small quantity
of air violently through this opening; retain the
respiration, again throw out a little air in the same
way; retain again, and so forth, in the same way,
until the lungs are completely emptied of air.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. Take a shorter but deep breath, lasting from three
to five seconds.</p>

</div>

<p>This exercise acts as a washer and cleanser of the lungs in
forcing the pure air into the corners of the lungs and pushing
out the foul air accumulated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span></p>

<h3><i>The Special Deep Breathing Exercise</i><br />
No. II</h3>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing or sitting erect, with shoulders back,
but without strain, arms hung loosely downward to sides.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Inhale as deeply as possible.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Retain the air in the lungs as long as possible,
without strain.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Exhale the air vigorously through the open mouth.</p>

</div>

<p>This exercise has a beneficial influence upon the system of
respiration, the blood and the nervous system.</p>

<h3><i>The Special Deep Breathing Exercise</i><br />
No. III</h3>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Standing erect, with shoulders back, but without
strain, arms hung loosely downward to sides.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Inhale as deeply as possible through the nose.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Stretch both arms easily outward to sides in line
with shoulders.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Bring the hands to the shoulders, gradually contracting
the hands in such a way that when they
reach the shoulders the fists are very strongly
clenched.</p>

<p class="hanging">4. During this tension of the muscles, bend the fists
rapidly outward and inward from ten to twenty
times.</p>

<p class="hanging">5. Exhale the air vigorously through the mouth, at the
same time dropping the arms loosely downward
to sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p class="hanging">6. Take a shorter but deep breath, lasting three to
five seconds.</p>

</div>

<p>Besides being beneficial to the lungs, the respiratory
muscles and the heart; this exercise is also very beneficial for
the vitality of the nerves, especially those of the brachial plexus
(the nerves of the arms, shoulders, upper back and upper
chest).</p>

<h3><i>The General Deep Breathing Exercise<br />
A</i></h3>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Arms hanging loosely at sides or place hands on
hips, elbows and shoulders thrown backward, without
strain.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Inhale as deeply as possible, at the same time rising
on toes.</p>

<p class="hanging">3. Exhale through the mouth, at the same time sinking
on heels.</p>

</div>

<h3><i>The General Deep Breathing Exercise<br />
B</i></h3>

<p><i>Position.</i>—Arms outstretched horizontally to the front and
parallel to each other.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">1. Inhale as deeply as possible, at the same time bringing
the arms horizontally outward to the sides and
continuing as far back as possible, while rising on
toes.</p>

<p class="hanging">2. Exhale through the mouth while dropping the arms
slowly downward to the sides and sinking on heels.</p>

</div>

<p>Exercises <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> may also be done without rising on
toes, but this exercise greatly strengthens the feet and ankles
and the muscles of the legs and gives a good poise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span></p>

<p>When practicing the breathing exercises <i>A</i> and <i>B</i>, both legs
may be bent and stretched at the same time, and this will
further strengthen the legs.</p>

<p>All these breathing exercises are especially beneficial for
singers and public speakers.</p>

<h3>SPECIAL REMARKS</h3>

<p>Always inhale through the nose.</p>

<p>The breathing exercises may, of course, be practiced separately
either indoors or outdoors.</p>

<p>If practiced indoors, it is important to have good ventilation
in the room.</p>

<p>If slight dizziness should result when practicing the special
breathing exercises separately, begin moderately, and as
the lungs become stronger, this feeling will gradually diminish.</p>

<p>Practicing the three special deep breathing exercises five
times each, without any long pause between, should consume
about five minutes. From five to ten minutes is sufficient for
one performance and, as a rule, this time limit should not be
exceeded. They can, of course, be practiced several times
a day.</p>

<p>Practicing thus all the combined massage exercises five
times each, and using fifteen seconds for the deep breathing
at each of those intervals, where indicated, will require about
twelve minutes, provided, of course, that the pauses between
the massage exercises and the deep breathing exercises are not
too long.</p>

<p>The five-times-limit is purely arbitrary and has been
selected merely as an illustration.</p>

<p>Practicing all the massage exercises ten times each, and in
the manner just explained, will not necessarily make the whole
performance last twice as long, as when they are practiced
five times each, because the time for the breathing exercises
will remain the same.</p>

<p>When explaining in the detailed description how special
deep breathing can be done during the practice of massage
exercises Nos. 5, 7 and 13, it was with the particular intention
that this should be done chiefly in instances where one or two
of these exercises are practiced separately and when the performer
has only a few minutes to spare. However, even when
all the massage exercises are practiced together, Nos. 5, 7 and
13 may also be performed in that way, but in that case only
natural breathing and no special deep breathing exercises
should be done at the intervals.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span></p>

<p>On the whole, practice of a deep breathing exercise at the
intervals is more practical, although the one method is about
as beneficial as the other. But to do special deep breathing
during the practice of some of the exercises themselves, as
well as at the intervals in the same performance would be out
of proportion.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="DECREASE">HOW THE NUMBER OF EXERCISES FOR ONE PERFORMANCE CAN

</div>

<p>Elderly people, children and others whose memory is not
of the best and who may, therefore, find it inconvenient to
remember all the exercises in the beginning or later can shorten
the number of exercises for one performance in the following
ways:</p>

<p class="center">Eleven Massage Exercises<br />
Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 14 A</p>

<p class="center">Nine Massage Exercises<br />

<p class="center">Five Massage Exercises<br />
Nos. 1, 4, 7, 13 and 14</p>

<p>Of course, these groupings may be modified in any other
order and number with benefit, but the ones here indicated
are the best and most practical. The ideal manner, however,
is to practice all the exercises together in the order mentioned.</p>

<span class="smaller">PRACTICING THE MOVEMENTS OF THE BODY WITHOUT THE MASSAGE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The movements or exercises of the arms, legs and the body
in the combined massage exercises may also be done without the
massage.</p>

<p>Thus, when dressed, the arms, legs and trunk may perform
the same movements as when massaging, but without the
hands touching the clothes. Done in this way, the hands should
move at a distance of about two inches from the clothes and
be firmly clenched while exercising, thus contracting and concentrating
on the muscles of the arms and also as far as possible
concentrating the mind on those other parts of the body
put into play by an exercise.</p>

<p>In this way another concentration system, similar if not
better than the Indian exercises, is obtained. Of course, this
is not nearly as efficient as when done without clothes and with
the addition of the massage. It might be desirable to try them
in that way at a time when exercise is needed, and there is no
time, or convenience for the removal of clothes.</p>

<p>Deep breathing can also with great benefit be combined
to some of these exercises in the same way as explained under
the detailed description of the massage exercises.</p>

<span class="smaller">HOW THE EXERCISES MAY BE UTILIZED IN SOME DISEASED AND DISORDERED
CONDITIONS OF THE BODY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>The massage exercises and deep breathing exercises may
be used with benefit in certain stages of different diseases.
This should, of course, be done only on the recommendation
of a physician.</p>

<p>Inasmuch as the same disease does not attack all people
to the same degree, it is, of course, impossible to state exactly
when or at which stage of a disease the patient might begin
to practice the exercises. Neither can it be said precisely how
long an exercise or performance shall last in each case; it will
vary from five to twenty minutes. This is a matter for the
family physician to decide; however, the following hints may
be in order. If the use of the exercises practiced moderately
is recommended, begin them slowly for five or ten minutes
daily (or as long as advised by the doctor) with a light pressure
of the hands, and continue thus for several days. The
exercises can then be made more vigorous by increasing the
pressure of the hands to a moderate or stronger degree. The
time can then likewise be increased to fifteen or twenty minutes
in proportion to the improvement in the condition and
strength of the performer.</p>

<p>It is not meant to imply that it is necessary to immediately
hurry to a doctor or hospital when disorders of a mild character
occur; for instance, a slight pain or stiffness in the
muscles of one of the limbs or other part of the body, a headache,
obesity without complications or slight constipation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span></p>

<p>If three or more massage exercises are recommended for
one performance, a general deep breathing exercise can likewise
be practiced between each of those.</p>

<p>Here may be noted, especially for the interest of physicians,
the particular exercises which are most suitable for use
in various diseases. There are other conditions than the ones
mentioned below, in which the exercises might be used with
benefit, but the following are the most important:</p>

<ul>
<li>Anaemia</li>
<li>Headache</li>
<li>Disorders of the Digestive System</li>
<li>Disorders of the Liver</li>
<li>Diabetes</li>
<li>Affections of the Lungs</li>
<li>Disordered Conditions of the Heart</li>
<li>Insomnia</li>
<li>Muscular Disorders</li>
<li>Nervous Diseases</li>
<li>Obesity</li>
<li>Curvature of the Spine</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="ANAEMIA">ANAEMIA</h3>

<p>All the massage exercises may be practiced once or twice
daily. In addition, all the deep breathing exercises may be
done separately, without strain, for five or ten minutes, twice
daily.</p>

<h3 id="HEADACHE">HEADACHE</h3>

<p>Here special reference is made to massage exercise No. 1,
although all the exercises will prove of indirect benefit.</p>

<h3 id="DIGESTIVE">DISORDERS OF THE DIGESTIVE SYSTEM</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Constipation—Gas in the Stomach—Stasis—Dilatation of
the Stomach—Chronic Dyspepsia—Deficient
Peristaltic Action, etc.</i>)</p>

<p>Reference is here made especially to massage exercise No.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
10, and also to Nos. 3 and 5. All the deep breathing exercises
may be used. If the patient is so weak that the trunk cannot
be bent much, No. 10 may be practiced first and Nos. 3 and 5
later. No. 10 can even be practiced by patients confined to
bed.</p>

<p>For dilatation of the stomach, chronic dyspepsia and conditions
of stasis, No. 10 is very beneficial, and may be used for
ten or fifteen minutes two or three times a day. It causes
contraction of the stomach, the pylorus is opened and the contents
are emptied into the duodenum. Sour and burning eructations,
bad breath and taste in the mouth will disappear. In
these cases it is best to practice the exercise from four to five
hours after a meal. (The massage movements in No. 10 has
been taught by the author to several mothers from out of town,
who have applied them with success to their babies suffering
from gas in the stomach and indigestion caused by nervous
disorders.)</p>

<p>In order to increase the flow of bile, pancreatic juice and
the succus entericus and to get a mixture of these, a well-known
medical authority in Europe massaged (stroking and
pressing) the abdomen from the right side toward the median
line for about half an hour after the stomach digestion had
ceased. The average amount of the juices thus obtained in
each of twenty cases was from 40 to 50 c.c. This movement
is included in massage exercise No. 10 and also somewhat in
exercises Nos. 3 and 5.</p>

<p>In a case of a dropped stomach or colon, a special movement
of stroking and pressing (especially with the fingers)
may be used across the abdomen in an upward direction, from
each opposite side of the lower abdomen, thus crossing the
abdomen with each hand, alternately.</p>

<p>A good movement for breaking up adhesions in the region
of the appendix is stroking with the fingers of the right hand
(pressing on top with the left) upward over the appendix, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
ascending colon and then continuing over the transverse colon.
For adhesions in the left side of the abdomen a similar movement
with the fingers of the left hand is recommended. Massage
exercises Nos. 10 and 3 are also here beneficial.</p>

<p>In order to relieve the bowels of their distension, one doctor
in New York advocated massaging the abdomen thirty hours
after operations for appendicitis and hernia.</p>

<h3 id="LIVER">DISORDERS OF THE LIVER</h3>

<p>Reference is here made to massage exercises Nos. 2, 3, 4,
6, 8, 14 and 14 A, as well as to all the deep breathing exercises.</p>

<p>They will stimulate the secretion of the bile from the blood
and cause readier transformation of excess sugar into glycogen.</p>

<p>The massage exercises are also beneficial for hepatic
engorgement.</p>

<h3 id="DIABETES">DIABETES</h3>

<p>All the massage and deep breathing exercises are recommended
for the reason that they cause an increased oxygenation
in all parts of the body and will therefore help to prevent
abnormal deposits of sugar.</p>

<h3 id="LUNGS">AFFECTIONS OF THE LUNGS</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Pneumonia—Tuberculosis—Asthma</i>)</p>

<p>Massage exercises Nos. 2 and 14 are here especially referred
to as well as all the deep breathing exercises.</p>

<p>Convalescence from pneumonia has been shortened and
eased by massaging the painful muscles which are at times
concomitants of lung affections.</p>

<p>The massaging over the chest will cause freer breathing
and expectoration.</p>

<p>In the first stage of tuberculosis all the massage exercises<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
done with a light or moderate pressure and all the deep breathing
exercises, practiced once or twice daily are beneficial.</p>

<p>In asthma all the exercises are likewise recommended.</p>

<h3 id="HEART">DISORDERED CONDITIONS OF THE HEART</h3>

<p>In severe cases, massage exercises Nos. 2 and 14 may be
used, with a light pressure for five minutes, two or three times
a day. The special deep breathing exercise No. 2 and the general
deep breathing exercises may also be practiced slowly and
without strain.</p>

<p>For milder cases reference is made to massage exercises
Nos. 2, 4, 5, 9, 13 and 14.</p>

<h3 id="INSOMNIA">INSOMNIA</h3>

<p>All the massage exercises practiced for ten or fifteen minutes
without exertion half an hour before going to bed are
recommended.</p>

<h3 id="MUSCULAR">MUSCULAR DISORDERS</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Stiffness and Pain—Atrophy and Distrophy—Lumbago</i>)</p>

<p>For stiffness in the neck, use massage exercise No. 1.</p>

<p>For stiffness in the shoulders, massage exercise No. 12 is
beneficial.</p>

<p>For muscular disturbance in an arm, massage exercise
No. 2 is recommended.</p>

<p>For pain in the muscles of the lower back, massage exercises
Nos. 6 and 8 are very beneficial.</p>

<p>For muscular disturbance in the lower limbs, massage exercises
Nos. 3 and 3 A may be used.</p>

<p>For stiffness in the muscles of the upper chest, massage
exercises Nos. 12 and 14 are indicated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span></p>

<h3 id="NERVOUS">NERVOUS DISEASES</h3>

<p class="center">(<i>Neuritis—Neuralgia—Sciatica—General Nervousness
or Neurasthenia</i>)</p>

<p>In any kind of nervous disease of a mild character, all the
massage exercises and the deep breathing exercises might be
practiced two or three times a day.</p>

<p>For neuritis or neuralgia in the arms, massage exercise
No. 2 can be practiced, after the acute stage has passed.</p>

<p>For facial neuralgia, massage exercise No. 1 is recommended,
with stroking from each cheek instead of from the
temple.</p>

<p>In sciatica, massage exercise No. 3 is beneficial; if the
attack is severe exercise No. 3 A may be used.</p>

<p>In cases of general nervousness or debility resulting from
overwork, strain or other cause, all the massage exercises can
be used from ten to twenty minutes two or three times a day,
according to the condition of the patient.</p>

<p>In cases of partial paralysis of an arm or leg, exercises Nos.
2, 3 or 3 A may be used respectively.</p>

<h3 id="OBESITY">OBESITY</h3>

<p>All the massage and deep breathing exercises are recommended.</p>

<p>If most pronounced, about the waist, reference is especially
made to massage exercises Nos. 3, 3 A, 5, 7, 10, 11 and 14 A.</p>

<p>In the case that the heart and other organs are not especially
affected, the performer may practice these massage exercises
with a strong pressure for twenty minutes or more, or
until practically tired out.</p>

<h3 id="SPINE">CURVATURE OF THE SPINE</h3>

<p>Although all the massage exercises may here be used with
benefit, Nos. 6, 8, 13, 5 and 1 are especially referred to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span></p>

<p>In hospitals where children (mostly girls from ten to sixteen
years of age) attend gymnastic classes for correction of
the spine no massage treatment is given them as a rule. This
is probably because there is no time for both exercises and
massage treatment. The latter, however, would greatly help
to nourish and strengthen the weak muscles which are associated
with curvatures of the spine.</p>

<p>In massage exercises Nos. 6 and 8, and to a lesser degree
in Nos. 13 and 5, massage of each side of the back (except
the uppermost parts) is obtained at the same time. No. 1 is
included in the ones especially recommended, because the
movements of the arms in this exercise strengthens the upper
part of the back.</p>

<p class="tb">In all diseased or disordered conditions, proper breathing
at all times should be remembered.</p>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
